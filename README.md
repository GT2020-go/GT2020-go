### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# I'm GaÃ«tan

## Do you need a developer on your team? 

**You've come to the right place!**

I am a former supply chain engineer who converted into web development with React and NodeJS. I have completed nearly 10+ frontend, backend and full stack projects! 

## My thing?

I learn all the time: from foreign languages to technology, including cryptocurrencies. I use my past experiences to improve the way I work: project management, the importance of routine to perform,...

**What if you contacted me so that I could show you what I do?**

See Ya!
